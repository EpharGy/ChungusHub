/**
 * Which snapshots survive.
 *
 * Two ideas, and the split is the point. A snapshot taken because something was ABOUT to
 * happen (an upgrade, a restore) or because a person asked for one is evidence, and
 * evidence is not thinned on a timer. A scheduled snapshot is a position on a timeline, and
 * a timeline needs recent detail far more than it needs every point on it, so past the
 * recent window they thin to one a week, then one a month, then stop.
 *
 * That thinning is what makes "go back to last spring" a real answer rather than a slogan:
 * roughly thirty scheduled snapshots cover a year, and hardlinking means the images in them
 * are stored once.

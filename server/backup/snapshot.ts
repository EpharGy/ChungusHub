/**
 * Taking a snapshot of the data dir while the app is running.
 *
 * Three properties hold it together. The database is copied with `VACUUM INTO`, which is
 * transactional over the live file and picks up whatever the WAL is still holding, so
 * nothing has to be stopped or locked. Files unchanged since the previous snapshot are
 * HARDLINKED from it rather than copied, which is what makes keeping a year of history
 * affordable. And the whole thing is built where it will live behind a `.building` marker
 * that is deleted last, so a snapshot that is listed is a snapshot that is whole. Deleting
 * one small file is the commit, because Windows will not reliably rename a directory that
 * has just had thousands of files written into it.
 *
 * This module runs in the job child process (see `job.ts`) and must never reach for
 * `serverDb`: the live handle belongs to the server, and the questions asked here are asked
 * of the copy that was just written.

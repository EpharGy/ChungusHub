/**
 * Live-sync scope vocabulary, shared by both sides of the bridge.
 *
 * The server tags every mutation with one of these and broadcasts it; each client
 * translates the hint into a targeted store reload. A scope that exists on one side
 * only is the quiet failure this module exists to prevent: the mutation succeeds, the
 * broadcast goes out, and the other device just keeps showing stale data.
 *
 * Adding a scope: one entry here, then the compiler names both ends, the server's
 * `MUTATION_SCOPES` (db.ts) and the client's scope→reload table (services/sync.ts,
 * typed `Record<SyncScope, …>`) both stop compiling until they agree.

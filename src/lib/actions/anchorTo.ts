/**
 * Svelte action: lifts a floating panel out of the layout and glues it to an anchor.
 *
 * Every hover explanation in the app places itself through here, so no two of them
 * can drift apart. A bubble left in normal flow is offset from its nearest
 * positioned ancestor and clipped by the nearest scroll container, and the
 * workspace nests panels inside several `overflow: hidden` docks, so the tail of
 * the text is simply gone, with no way to reach it. Naming a side by hand only
 * picks which edge it falls off: the same bubble that fits in the settings column
 * runs off the left of a 320px assistant panel.
 *
 * So the node moves to `<body>` and lives in viewport coordinates, where nothing
 * can clip it, and the side is measured rather than declared: below the anchor
 * unless it doesn't fit there and does fit above, then pushed back inside both
 * edges. The result lands on the node as `data-placement="below" | "above"` so a
 * component can point its enter animation the right way, and `data-open` follows a
 * frame later so a CSS transition has a from-state to run out of.
 *
 * Render the node only while it should be visible. The node and the action live
 * and die together, which is what keeps this clear of the always-mounted portal
 * trap in architecture/ui-shell-settings.md, since there is no effect whose
 * cleanup can outlive what it detached:
 *
 *     {#if open}
 *         <span class="bubble" use:anchorTo={triggerEl}>…</span>
 *     {/if}

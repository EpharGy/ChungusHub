/**
 * Svelte action: hands a settings row's whole area to the switch it contains.
 *
 * A switch is a ~40px target sitting at the far end of a row as wide as the
 * settings column (`--settings-measure`), so pointer users pay a long travel for
 * a small hit box, the motor half of the label-is-miles-from-its-control
 * problem (the visual half is the hover band on `.toggle-row` in app.css; the
 * measure is capped on the column, never per row). This widens the target to the
 * row without adding a second tab stop: the switch stays the only focusable
 * thing in there, so keyboard and screen-reader behaviour is untouched.
 *
 * **The row is the switch, including what it refuses to do.** Every other
 * click-the-whole-row surface in the app is a real `<button>`, which app.css makes
 * `user-select: none`; this one is a plain div that borrowed a button's meaning,
 * so it has to borrow the rest by hand. Left to the browser, a double click means
 * two different things three pixels apart (over a word it highlights the word,
 * over the gap beside it it flips the switch twice), and nothing on screen says
 * which one you are about to get. So the row refuses the multi-click selection
 * step, and nothing else: a deliberate drag over the label still selects it. That
 * is the whole rule. A press that travels is a drag and belongs to the text; a
 * press that lands where it started is a click and belongs to the row; neither
 * asks what is selected elsewhere on the page.
 *
 * Usage: <div class="toggle-row" use:toggleRow> … <Toggle … /> </div>
 * It works on any row shape, not just the `.toggle-row` recipe: Security's
 * password lock, the assistant's permission cards and the lorebook globals all
 * roll their own markup. The action stamps `data-row-toggle` so app.css can hand
 * those the pointer cursor too, gated on the same `[role="switch"]:not(:disabled)`
 * this handler checks so the affordance and the behaviour can't disagree.
 *
 * Do NOT put this on a row that already means something else when clicked: the
 * Engines list row drills into a detail page and the Regex rule row expands, and
 * a second meaning on the same click is a bug, not a convenience.

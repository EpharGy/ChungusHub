	/**
	 * The standing channel of the notification contract (architecture/ui-shell-settings.md).
	 *
	 * One condition, and it is the one the app could never say: the server is unreachable. A
	 * dropped connection breaks generations, stops other devices' changes from arriving and
	 * fails every write, and until this bar existed all of that happened behind an interface
	 * that looked perfectly healthy.
	 *
	 * It is a full-width row in normal flow rather than a corner badge, which is what makes it
	 * work identically on a phone and a desktop: it takes no corner to fight over, it costs
	 * zero pixels while the connection is fine, and it cannot be covered by a panel the way a
	 * floating mark can. The layout shift when it appears is the message, not a side effect.
	 *
	 * Individual write failures stay toasts and are NOT folded in here. The two say different
	 * things: this one says the server is gone, a toast names the one value that did not land,
	 * and only the toast tells the reader what to do again once the connection is back.

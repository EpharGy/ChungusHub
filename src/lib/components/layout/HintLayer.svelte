	/**
	 * Hint labels over every control on screen: the app's answer to reaching a target that is
	 * visible but far from wherever the keyboard currently is.
	 *
	 * Its value is that it needs nothing from the surfaces it labels. A panel becomes reachable
	 * by keyboard the moment its controls are real buttons, so no screen has to be taught arrow
	 * navigation of its own for the app to be usable without a mouse. What it cannot label is
	 * exactly what it should not hide: a `<div>` with a click handler has no label here, and
	 * that absence is a straight reading of where the markup is not semantic yet.
	 *
	 * **It is a mode, not a gesture**: the labels stay up until they are switched off, and
	 * re-label after every press instead of vanishing on the first one, because picking a
	 * control is usually the first of several moves and pressing the key again between each of
	 * them is the work this exists to remove. What it costs is the letters: while the labels
	 * are up they are spellings and not text, which is why picking a box to TYPE in switches
	 * the mode off on the way, and why Escape is always the way out.
	 *
	 * The open flag lives with the key that raises it (`commands/shortcuts.svelte.ts`).

	/**
	 * The app's one asking surface for destructive acts on things not fully in front of the
	 * reader (the destructive-act ladder, architecture/ui-shell-settings.md). The message
	 * names the thing in quotes and states the real numbers of what goes.
	 *
	 * `holdMs` is the heavy rung: pass `holdMsForBlast(n)` with the same count the message
	 * states and a big enough loss turns the confirm into a press-and-hold, the identical
	 * gesture the transcript's subtree delete uses, so muscle memory alone can never fire
	 * it. Zero (the default, and everything under HOLD_THRESHOLD) stays a plain click.
	 *
	 * `destructive` puts the dialog on the ladder, which is what lets the reader's rung skip
	 * it entirely. It is opt-in on purpose: this component also carries cost confirmations,
	 * assistant approvals and discard-draft prompts, none of which are deletes, and a new one
	 * of those must not become skippable by inheriting a default it never asked for.

/**
 * Tree-/branch-aware coverage resolution.
 *
 * The chat is a message tree; memory follows the active path (root → active leaf). What is
 * archived is not stored anywhere: it is **derived** from the episodes themselves, by
 * tiling the active path with their coverage from the root and stopping at the first gap.
 *
 * That derivation is the whole reason memory survives branching. The same stored episodes
 * yield a deep boundary on a long timeline and a shallow one on a branch that forks below
 * it, and neither answer costs a write. Walking back to the long timeline restores the
 * deep boundary exactly, because the episodes were never touched.
 *
 * So an episode is in one of three standings against the path you are looking at:
 *
 * - **active**: its turns are on this path, inside the tail window, and part of the
 *   gap-free run from the root. It is recalled, and its turns are ghosted.
 * - **dormant**: still perfectly good, just not applicable here. Its turns are on another
 *   branch, or they are inside the verbatim tail, or they sit past a gap this path has.
 *   Kept untouched. It applies again the moment the path comes back to it.
 * - **dead**: it can never apply again. A turn it covers no longer exists in the chat, or
 *   was rewritten after the summary was written, or its coverage has a hole in the path it
 *   otherwise sits on. The summary describes something nobody can read (or nothing this
 *   walk can tile with), so the caller reaps it.
 *
 * Everything here is pure and works off plain message slices, so it is unit-testable with
 * no app dependencies.

 * The SETTINGS ride the settings spine like every other preference, so the schedule a
 * phone sets is the schedule the desktop keeps. The server reads the same row to run its
 * timer, which is why `normalize` here and the server's copy have to agree on the clamps
 * (architecture/backups.md coupling 2).
 *
 * The LISTING is server state and is fetched, never cached across sessions. It refreshes on
 * the `backups` sync scope so another device's snapshot appears, and polls only while a job
 * is actually running. A snapshot is a few times a day, and a page that polls when nothing
 * is happening is a page that wakes a sleeping phone for nothing.

/**
 * The message cursor: which turn of the open story the keyboard is on.
 *
 * The transcript is long and Tab is not navigation, so a turn a hundred messages back has to
 * be ADDRESSED rather than stepped to. Three doors land on this one cursor, and the store is
 * deliberately the only thing they share: the transcript's own arrows (near), find in chat's
 * live hit (anywhere in the branch), and `/go` (a turn number, which every message already
 * wears under its portrait).
 *
 * **Marking and taking are separate facts.** `mark` says which turn the cursor is on and
 * paints the ring; `goTo` also moves the keyboard there. Find in chat marks every hit while
 * the reader is still typing in its field, and a mark that stole focus would empty that box
 * on the first match.
 *
 * The cursor belongs to ONE story: it is stamped with the chat it was set in and reads as
 * absent everywhere else, so a chat switch drops it with nothing to clean up.
 *
 * See architecture/chat-sessions.md, "The message cursor".

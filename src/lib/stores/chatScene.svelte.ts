/**
 * Which scene the open chat wears.
 *
 * A chat either follows the app's background and ambient mix or carries a whole scene of
 * its own, stored on its own row (`feature_state`, architecture/chat-sessions.md). A whole
 * scene rather than a patch: with every field answered in one place nothing on screen has
 * to say which half of a picture is inherited, and flipping the switch on seeds the chat
 * from what is already on screen, so the press itself changes nothing.
 *
 * Switching back off KEEPS the chat's scene. The switch is a switch, not a way to lose an
 * afternoon's tuning, and it is what spares this control the destructive-act ladder.
 *
 * Writes are debounced because a chat row write broadcasts the `chats` scope, which every
 * other device answers with a chat-list refetch: a slider drag would send one per frame.
 * The pending scene is what the app reads meanwhile, so the drag still paints at full rate,
 * and the write carries the chat id it started on, so switching chats mid-flight lands it
 * on the story it was made for.

 * Find-in-chat: whether the search bar is up over the message list, and what it is

 * A chat satellite like chatSelection, deliberately NOT part of uiStore's panel
 * choreography: the bar is inline chat chrome, not a workspace surface, so it must be
 * able to sit open alongside a docked Settings or Library without either closing the
 * other. The matches themselves live in the bar: they are DOM Ranges over the rendered
 * transcript (see utils/chat-search.ts), so only the mounted component can own them.
 *
 * Query and options survive a close/reopen and a chat switch, the way a browser's find
 * bar remembers what you last looked for.

/**
 * Reactive viewport flags. `canDockSettings` is true only when the window is
 * wide enough to host the Settings panel in the margin beside the centered chat
 * column without eating into the transcript. Below that, Settings falls back to
 * the centered overlay.
 *
 * 76rem is derived, not tuned: while there is room the screen splits in halves
 * (chat one half, the two docks the other); once a quarter would put a dock under
 * `--dock-hold` the docks stop shrinking and the chat absorbs the narrowing, so
 * the breakpoint is `--chat-col-min + 2 × --dock-hold`, the width at which that
 * squeezing reaches the chat's own floor. app.css spells the same equation on
 * `--chat-col-docked` (assigned to `--chat-col-max` inside that branch) and caps
 * the column at `100vw - 28rem`, which is what makes this plain media query
 * truthful at every chat-width setting instead of needing a geometry check here.
 * Change the two together. Deliberately rem, not px: the threshold
 * then tracks browser zoom and the user's browser font size the same way the
 * column itself does. And note it is measured against the browser's viewport,
 * which on a laptop is a good 50px narrower than the screen resolution.

 * the reader sees as one run of text and the DOM stores as three separate nodes.
 *
 * Nothing here mutates message markup: matches come back as DOM Ranges, which the search
 * bar paints through the CSS Custom Highlight API. Svelte's {@html} ownership, Copy, and
 * the chatSelection hand-off to the assistant all stay byte-identical.

/**
 * Portrait framing: where every avatar box aims inside a character's picture.
 *
 * The library stores a focal point and a zoom, never cropped bytes, because one portrait
 * is shown at several aspect ratios at the same time (2:3 and 1:1 chat avatars, 3:4
 * browse cards, a 60x80 list row), and the chat's own silhouette is a setting the reader
 * can change long after the framing was authored. A baked rectangle is right in one box
 * and wrong in the rest, and it would be re-cropped by every box that disagrees with it.
 * A focal point resolves correctly in any box, the original file is never touched, and a
 * framing can always be reopened and moved.
 *
 * `object-fit: cover` guarantees the picture is at least as large as its box in both
 * axes, so any focal point in 0..1 at any zoom >= 1 still covers the box: there is no
 * combination of these numbers that can leave a gap.

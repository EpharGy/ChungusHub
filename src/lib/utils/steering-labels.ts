/**
 * Human labels for steering scopes: the shared half between the composer popover and
 * the manager panel (architecture/engines.md). Both need to say the same thing about the same
 * note; a second copy of these lookups is how one surface starts calling a note
 * "Character" while the other names the character.
 *
 * Two vocabularies, kept apart on purpose: `scopeChoices` names the RUNGS of the ladder
 * (a picker, a set of group headings), `bindingLabel` names what ONE note is bound to.
 *
 * Store-sourced on purpose (the live-macro-context precedent): scope ids resolve against
 * whatever the library and chat list currently hold, and a MISSING row is labeled, never
 * hidden: a note bound to a deleted character is inert but must still be findable.

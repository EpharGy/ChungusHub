/**
 * Word-level diff for Spellcheck's proposal in the composer's transform panel: given the
 * draft before and the model's corrected version after, produce an ordered list of
 * equal/removed/added spans a UI can render as strikethrough + inserted text.
 *
 * Spellcheck's, and deliberately not Impersonate's, though the two share that panel: a
 * redline is the right reading of small edits over the same text, and the wrong reading of
 * a full message grown from a one-line note, where the two texts share only accidental
 * words and the result is an unreadable weave. Impersonate shows what it wrote instead.
 *
 * Tokens split on whitespace RUNS, keeping each run as its own token (never merged into
 * neighboring words). This is what makes reconstruction byte-perfect: concatenating every
 * `equal`/`removed` segment's text reproduces `before` exactly, and every `equal`/`added`
 * segment's text reproduces `after` exactly, whitespace included. See text-diff.test.ts.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from utils/diff.ts (the assistant's edit preview): that one is
 * line-first and renders a change as PAIRED del/add rows, each side its own segment list:
 * right for line-shaped assistant edits, wrong for a one-paragraph composer draft. This one
 * emits a single interleaved stream for an inline redline, and guarantees the reconstruction
 * invariant above, which diff.ts neither needs nor offers. Only the ~20-line LCS walk is
 * shared in shape; folding them together would couple this contract to untested render code.
